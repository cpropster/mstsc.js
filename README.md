**Mstsc.js** is a pure javascript Microsoft RDP (Remote Desktop Client) client using nodejs, [**node-rdpjs**](https://github.com/citronneur/node-rdpjs) and socket.io. It allows you to connect to any terminal server compatible application, through a web browser (optimized for firefox, but compatible with chrome and internet explorer 11 too).

## How does it works ?

### Frontend

The frontend application uses socket.io and canvas for binding with mstsc.js backend. The front-end is in charge of bitmap decompression through rle.js file. This file is generated by [**Emscripten**](https://github.com/kripken/emscripten) from [rle.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citronneur/mstsc.js/master/obj/rle.c) which comes from rdesktop source.

### Backend

The backend application uses nodejs, express and socket.io as the web server. The main goal of the backend is to be a proxy between the web browser and the terminal server. It uses [**node-rdpjs**](https://github.com/citronneur/node-rdpjs) for its rdp client.
